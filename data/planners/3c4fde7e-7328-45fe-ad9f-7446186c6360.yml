description: |
  The response planner is designed to run in a phaseless response operation, executing abilities within the detection,
  hunt, and response tactics. Its purpose is to automatically retrieve detections on endpoints, hunt for similar
  occurrences on other endpoints within the operation, and to respond to the detections in order to minimize the impact
  of adversary activity.
